# Time Helm

- Open-source 
- Persistent-world 
- Massively-multiplayer online 
- Sandbox 
- Social simulation game


# Game Mechanics
- One hour in-game lasts one minute real-time.
- For the sake of "divide-by-60" symmetry, one game-year consists of 360 game-days.
- Game world and game rules are reality-centric (i.e. no supernatural or sci-fi elements)
- The ability of the player to control their character(s) is dependent on the avatar's emotional state, like `The Sims` but perhaps to a greater extent
- Players mostly (only?) control their characters indirectly, specifying a schedule and if-then conditions


# Graphics
- Low-poly 3D graphics
- Graphical realism and animation are a secondary concern 



# Technical

- Built with Godot Engine


# Planned Development Path
- Start with a person in a house, with modern amenities that are puchased from "outside world"
OR
- Start with a person in a cave?


# Required Research
- How long does it take to make basic things?
- How productive are ancient farming techniques?


# Other Ideas
- Once sufficiently realistic, can be used as platform for modelling and tracing human history in detail, and assessing different hypotheses
